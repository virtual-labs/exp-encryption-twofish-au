      "question": "What does the F function in Twofish involve?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Bitwise XOR only",
        "b": "Substitution-permutation networks, key mixing, and bitwise operations",
        "c": "Modular addition only",
        "d": "Feistel network structure"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The F function in Twofish involves more than just bitwise XOR.",
        "b": "Correct. The F function in Twofish is a complex combination of operations.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The F function involves more than just modular addition.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The F function does not solely rely on the Feistel network structure."

    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the Mixing and Swapping step in Twofish?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To add an extra layer of security",
        "b": "To ensure both halves contribute to the final output",
        "c": "To perform key mixing",
        "d": "To divide the block into fixed-size blocks"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The purpose of Mixing and Swapping is not to add an extra layer of security.",
        "b": "Correct. Mixing and Swapping ensures both halves contribute to the final output.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Key mixing is a separate step in Twofish.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Dividing the block into fixed-size blocks is done in the Block Division step."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Twofish operates on blocks larger than 64 bits.",
        "b": "Correct. Twofish operates on 128-bit blocks.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Twofish does not operate on 256-bit blocks.",
